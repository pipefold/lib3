computation, notably for its efficient performance"

I mean to make a list of all such algorithms that lend themselves to GPU
parallelization, such that they might be composed/combined together in
interesting ways

### Fundamental Categories for GPU-Parallelizable Algorithms

To categorize the algorithms I listed, I'll group them based on foundational
computational patterns or domains that make them particularly amenable to GPU
parallelization. GPUs excel at massive parallelism, especially for
data-independent operations, regular memory access, and SIMD (Single
Instruction, Multiple Data) execution. These categories highlight shared
characteristics like embarrassingly parallel workloads, reduction/scan
primitives, iterative convergence, or domain-specific structures (e.g., grids,
graphs, particles). Note that some algorithms overlap categories due to their
versatility (e.g., convolutions in both image processing and ML), and references
like JFA (a specific technique for Voronoi/Distance Transforms) or Bellman-Ford
(an implementation for SSSP) are noted where they fit as subtypes or examples.

I've organized this into high-level categories for clarity, with brief
explanations of why they suit GPUs and potential compositions.

#### 1. **Parallel Primitives and Building Blocks**

These are low-level operations that serve as foundations for more complex
algorithms. They often involve uniform data access and can be composed into
pipelines (e.g., a reduction feeding into a sort).

- **Prefix Sum (Scan)**: Enables cumulative operations; composable with sorting
  or histogramming.
- **Reduction Operations**: Aggregates data (e.g., sum/min/max); chains into ML
  gradients or statistics.
- **Histogram Computation**: Bins data in parallel; often combined with
  equalization or feature extraction like HOG.

#### 2. **Sorting Algorithms**

Focused on reordering large datasets with bitwise or merge-based parallelism,
ideal for GPUs due to thread-block synchronization. They compose well with
searching or grouping.

- **Radix Sort**: Bit-parallel for keys; useful in particle sorting or data
  preprocessing.
- **Bitonic Sort**: Merge networks for fixed sizes; integrates into rendering or
  ML data handling.

#### 3. **Image and Signal Processing**

Per-pixel or frequency-domain operations that are embarrassingly parallel,
leveraging texture memory and convolutions. These chain into vision pipelines
(e.g., blur → edge detection → feature matching).

- **Convolution Operations**: Kernel-based filtering; core to blurring or neural
  layers.
- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**: Butterfly parallelism for transforms;
  composable with frequency-domain filtering.
- **Gaussian Blur**: Separable convolutions; often precedes edge detection.
- **Sobel/Canny Edge Detection**: Gradient computations per pixel; links to
  segmentation.
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**: Block-parallel features; feeds into
  object detection.
- **Bilateral Filtering**: Weighted per-pixel smoothing; chains with denoising.
- **Optical Flow Estimation**: Dense per-pixel motion; composable with video
  tracking.
- **Seam Carving**: Energy maps in parallel; for resizing, combinable with
  content analysis.

#### 4. **Geometry and Spatial Algorithms**

Distance or region-based computations, often using flooding or sweeping for
parallel propagation. JFA is a key technique here, enabling efficient GPU
implementations.

- **Voronoi Diagram Computation**: Seed-based flooding (e.g., via JFA);
  composable with segmentation or robotics.
- **Distance Transform**: Parallel distance fields (related to JFA); chains into
  path planning or morphology.
- **Marching Cubes**: Voxel-parallel isosurfaces; integrates with volume
  rendering.

#### 5. **Graphics and Rendering**

Ray or sample-based methods that parallelize independent computations per ray or
fragment, suited to GPU's rasterization hardware.

- **Ray Tracing/Path Tracing**: Per-ray parallelism; composable with shading or
  Monte Carlo for noise reduction.
- **Monte Carlo Integration**: Random sampling; often used in rendering for
  approximations, linking to path tracing.

#### 6. **Graph and Search Algorithms**

Level-synchronous or relaxation-based traversals, parallelized across
nodes/edges despite irregularity (using atomic ops or work queues).

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Frontier-parallel levels; composable with
  shortest paths.
- **Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP)**: Iterative relaxation (e.g., via
  Bellman-Ford); chains into navigation or optimization.

#### 7. **Simulation and Physics**

Grid, particle, or element-based updates, parallel per entity with neighbor
interactions, exploiting GPU's compute shaders for real-time sims.

- **Particle Simulations (e.g., N-body)**: Per-particle forces; composable with
  collision detection.
- **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)**: Neighbor-parallel fluids; links to
  rendering.
- **Lattice Boltzmann Method**: Grid-cell parallelism for fluids; chains with
  boundaries.
- **Finite Element Method (FEM)**: Element-parallel assembly; for structural
  sims, composable with time-stepping.
- **Game of Life (Cellular Automata)**: Grid updates per cell; extends to
  pattern evolution or broader automata.

#### 8. **Machine Learning and Data Analysis**

Matrix-heavy or iterative algorithms with data parallelism across elements,
batches, or dimensions. These form building blocks for models (e.g., matrix mult
→ convolutions → activations).

- **Matrix Multiplication**: Dense parallelism; foundational for linear algebra
  in ML.
- **k-Means Clustering**: Per-point assignments; composable with dimensionality
  reduction.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Decomposition parallelism; chains into
  feature pipelines.
- **Neural Network Forward/Backward Pass**: Layer-parallel computations; highly
  composable in deep models.
- **Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV)**: Irregular but row-parallel;
  used in iterative solvers or graph ML.

This categorization isn't exhaustive or mutually exclusive, but it emphasizes
how these algorithms share GPU-friendly traits like high arithmetic intensity,
minimal divergence, and scalability. For instance, primitives (Cat. 1) often
underpin higher-level ones (e.g., reductions in ML or simulations). If you'd
like refinements, expansions, or examples of specific compositions, let me know!
